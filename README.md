# Circle-Detection
# Circle Detection Project using YOLOv8 from ultralytics
Detection is performed on a self-trained model using white circle edges on a black background.
All images were pre-formatted using Canny Edge Detection algorithm. It was implemented using OpenCV in Python (threshold1 = 250, threshold2 = 250).
